## Overview

The Dexible order form was a critical user-facing component but suffered from poor UX and inconsistent customer feedback loops. This project aimed to rebuild the form with customer input at every stage.

## Challenge

Users were struggling with the complexity of order placement, leading to:

- High abandonment rates
- Support tickets about form confusion
- Limited feature adoption
- Insufficient data collection

## Solution

I established a customer-centric product iteration process:

- **Feedback Collection**: Structured interviews and surveys with key users
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick iteration cycles based on feedback
- **A/B Testing**: Data-driven validation of design decisions
- **Phased Rollout**: Gradual deployment with continuous monitoring

The new form streamlined the order placement process while adding advanced options for power users.

## Results

The redesigned form achieved:

- **25% reduction** in form abandonment
- **Improved customer satisfaction** scores
- **Higher feature adoption** for advanced order types
- **Stronger customer relationships** through collaborative design
