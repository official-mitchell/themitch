## Overview

This case study covers the design and execution of a comprehensive B2B2C integration strategy for Dexible, a decentralized exchange aggregator.

## Challenge

Dexible needed to expand its reach beyond direct users and establish partnerships with other platforms and services. The challenge was creating a scalable integration approach that would allow partners to embed Dexible's functionality while maintaining quality and control.

## Solution

I developed a multi-tiered integration strategy that included:

- **Widgets & iFrames**: Simple embed options for partners to add Dexible functionality to their platforms
- **SDK**: A comprehensive developer kit for deeper integrations
- **Affiliate Program**: Revenue-sharing model to incentivize partner adoption
- **API Revamp**: Restructured the core API to support these new integration patterns

## Results

The integration strategy successfully:

- Secured major institutional clients
- Created new revenue streams through the affiliate program
- Enabled rapid partner onboarding
- Positioned Dexible as an essential infrastructure layer in the DeFi ecosystem
